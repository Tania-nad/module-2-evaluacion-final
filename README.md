# Anime Series Finder

This project is a website that functions as an anime series search engine. It uses **Vanilla JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **HTML**. The main goal of this page is to allow users to search for their favorite anime series, save them to a favorites list, and reset the page when needed.

## Features

- **Anime Search**: Users can search for anime series by entering the name in the search field. The search is case-insensitive, making it easier to find the series.
  
- **Favorites**: Users can add their favorite series to a "Favorites" list. The favorite series are stored locally in the browser so they remain available even after the page is reloaded.
  
- **Reset Button**: There is a "Reset" button that allows users to clear their favorite series and reset the page state.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Design and styling for the interface.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Logic for the search engine, favorites list, and reset functionality.
